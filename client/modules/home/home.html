      <h2>About this site</h2>
      <p><strong>If you landed here looking for someone named Brandon Lind
                and he isn’t a software architect / developer, you’re probably in the wrong
                place ;).</strong></p>
      <p>I use this site as a sandbox to keep current with emerging technologies and theories in web architecture and software development. As such, it’s usually pretty plain-vanilla, but under the covers, I’m practicing everything from developing using
        a cloud IDE (such as
        <a href="https://c9.io" target="_blank">Cloud9</a> or
        <a href="https://koding.com" target="_blank">Koding</a>) to using
        <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a> and deploying to
        <a href="https://heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a>.</p>
      <p>The server software also changes constantly. Sometime this site is developed using
        <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a>, sometimes
        <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Nodejs</a>. Typically for a persistence engine, I stick with
        <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>.</p>
      <p>The JavaScript framework also changes constantly, from
        <a href="http://backbonejs.org/" target="_blank">Backbone</a> to
        <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/" target="_blank">Knockout</a>,
        <a href="http://www.angularjs.org/" target="_blank">Angular</a> to
        <a href="http://www.kendoui.com/" target="_blank">KendoUI</a>, it’s always in flux and a majority of my changes are to this area.</p>
